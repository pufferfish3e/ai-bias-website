Task:
1. Use html, css and bootstrap to create responsive website
2. JavaScript to create interactive webpage

Assignment theme: 

For individuals aged 16 and above.

Open-ended theme, make a website based on a cause, community or concept that you are passionate about.

Chosen theme: 

About the theme:
The theme "Unfair by Design" sheds light on the unspoken shortcomings of artificial intelligence models-how they are trained, how easy it is to invoke biasness into the model, and how gullible models can be-based on data that favours one side and not the other. The website will highlight important steps users can take to prevent biasness within model training and identify biased prompts from a model.

Project Structure:
- index.html (hero section) You can’t spell ‘AI’ without ‘I’… but who’s the real problem? + visual
- scroll down, with an interactive conversation that comes up - a fictional scenario. 
text below: Can you really trust what you hear from AI?
button to find out more

- information.html
Overall structure -> like a google doc, but with flowing animations.
cards with statistics on them
graphs/charts that are animated to show values
content wise: 
biasness in AI (current statistics) - how much is true and unbiased while how much isnt?
example of a biased AI model (e.g. deepseek)
how will a Biased AI model affect/change in the future?

-interactive-form.html
A "forum" style page (with preloaded responses fitted into a component to fill up space)
form:
- text (name)
- rating (stars)
- text (share how insightful this was)
- checkbox (receive a copy)
- submit ("submit" to forum, stores result in array and displays it on screen.)

Requirements:
- 3-page website with html, css, js, bootstrap
- Homepage 
- Indicate chosen theme/cause in a visually engaging way. state message or objective.
- Informational Page
- Relevant content, future developments, or interesting insights related to the theme.
- Multi-column layout to organize data.
- Interactive form
- For visitors to share opinions, pledge support or submit related message (at least 5 different form controls??)
- for all above must use bootstrap

Technical stuff
- Can use stock images/photos (source in comments)
- Cannot use designs from other templates
- Viewed properly on chrome
- Graphics cannot exceed 800KB
- NO errors (must validate)
- Comment everything
- organization of files
- name properly

Deadline: 11 Aug (finish by July)
zip and submit on brightspace

Points to focus on:

interview:
- strong technical knowledge of design 
- explain trade offs (why bootstrap instead of css)
- deep insight into performance, usability and scalability
- can troubleshoot/ alternate implementation on the spot

content:
- purposeful, audience-specific and well-structured
- layout uses "grid system mastery"
- good typography and spacing

use of bootstrap:
- utility classes and responsive layouts and advanced components (modals, carousels and cards)
- advanced components not just for show. must use meaningfully
- can have customized styles without breaking responsiveness.

javascript: (high!!!!)
- modular and scalable (functional programming)
- uses event delegation (addEventListener, etc), named/arrow functions
- use dynamic DOM rendering (generate info from array)
- use logic for interactive features (toggle, image gallery, collapsible, or dynamic content)
- clean use of logic, loop and methods

Project Management
- organized like production project, (assets/, css/, js/, images, fonts/)
- modular and externally linked
-  fully validated, clean indentation, use semantic tags (main, section, article CORRECTLY.)
- images must be optimized for web

Interactive form
- at least 5 input types (radio, dropdown, textarea, range slider)
- form validation (custom conditions, inline feedback and edge case handling)
